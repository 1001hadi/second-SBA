# this project has been created for the PerScholes 2nd SBA.

## i have used and got help from stack overflow and w3 school for some parts of this project to solve the problem i was facing, that i mention them on my code with comments.

## the result is still 2 number digit, i try to add percentage, but it was show the result as string. i just removed the percentage and it come back to the number.

## i did not see any section that i can add switch statement.

# Reflection

## 1: i would spend more time for planing on my next project.

## 2: The logic and adding them to the code.

## spend more time and practice more logic.

## 3: with more time, I will convert some part to helper function for cleaner and more maintainable code.
